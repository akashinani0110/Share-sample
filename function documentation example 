Subject: Serious Concerns Regarding Employee Transport Experience

Dear [Transport/HR Team],

I’m writing this email with deep disappointment and frustration regarding the state of employee transportation services being provided.

Yesterday, I had an extremely unpleasant experience that reflects a broader pattern of negligence and insensitivity by the transport team. We were four passengers allocated to a sedan. The transport SPOC, spoke in a very rude and unprofessional tone, demanding we wear seatbelts and asking us to pull over. When we pointed out that the middle seat lacked a seatbelt, the vehicle was changed—only for the second car to also be unfit. It was only by the third car that the issue was resolved, but not before a 20-minute delay.

What’s most troubling is that vehicles are not being inspected or verified beforehand, which puts employee safety at risk and wastes precious time.

Beyond this one incident, there is a more serious, ongoing issue affecting every employee with a travel time of over one hour. The back seat of a sedan simply cannot accommodate three full-grown adults. It is not only cramped but physically painful. Employees are unable to sit properly, let alone rest their backs or heads. In case of an accident, all three individuals in the back seat would be at serious risk of injury.

Yet the transport team shows no genuine intent to resolve this.

Let me ask just three simple questions to any employee who travels more than an hour in a day:

1. Are you able to sit comfortably in the back seat of a sedan with two other colleagues?


2. Does this travel experience affect your physical well-being?


3. Would you rate the current cab arrangement as safe or suitable?



The answer to all of these would undoubtedly be negative.

Why is employee comfort and safety being compromised just to benefit cab vendors? Why are basic employee welfare concerns being ignored?

To make things worse, employees are not even being informed of the transport policy. For example, in Mumbai, there’s a rule restricting sedan occupancy to three passengers for long routes. Why is this not being enforced in Gurgaon?

A few critical points:

Employees deserve to know the rules and rights. Please circulate all transport policies to the employees.

Before assigning vehicles, proper inspection must be done—especially regarding seatbelts and spacing.

A simple feedback form sent to employees with long travel durations will easily reveal the 100% dissatisfaction rate with the current setup.

Female employees are being made to sit in cramped conditions next to male colleagues with no personal space—this is both uncomfortable and inappropriate.

It’s time to consider replacing three sedans with two SUVs, which is not only more cost-effective but also safer and more comfortable.


I hope this matter will be treated with the urgency and seriousness it demands. Employee safety cannot be optional.

Regards,
