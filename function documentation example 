Here’s a more polished version of your steps:

Steps to run the APC Viz (code is aligned with the Perforce version):

1. Clone the repository.


2. Switch to the required branch — currently, use xyz.


3. At the same directory level where viz_apc is cloned, create a folder named upstream_data.


4. Inside upstream_data, create a subfolder named apc.


5. Download and extract all APC project artifacts into the upstream_data/apc folder.


6. Ensure the viz_apc folder (cloned from Bitbucket) contains the required viz_apc data.

Rephrase

We are migrating to production server as there are compliant issues within uat server. Moreover publically accessible links need to be removed only password protected links are allowed.

Uat server gets down randomly with info and is mainly used for testing purposes
