Designed and implemented a shell script to automate project setup (cloning repos, fetching artifacts, and configuring environments), significantly reducing manual effort and setup time. Upcoming enhancements will cover deployment and preprocessing to achieve full end-to-end automation.

Automated dashboard screenshot capturing and integrated it with Python report generation—this improved consistency, saved manual effort, and accelerated reporting for stakeholders.

Enhanced the Pyatore dashboard to fetch real-time diagnostic data directly, reducing reliance on manual logs and improving turnaround time for support teams.

Developed an Excel export feature in the APC dashboard, enabling business users to independently generate actionable reports—reducing dependency on developers for data extraction.

Migrated dashboard codebase from Perforce to Bitbucket, improving operational efficiency via better version control, CI/CD readiness, and collaboration.

Completed a Data Science diploma with distinction, improving analytical capabilities to better support data-driven operational decisions.
